For my final project we are going to create a sort of long distance Skype call where two cameras and monitors are connected across campus. People will walk in and see a screen showing people across campus interacting with them.What will be different about it will be that the camera will recognize certain colors off of iphones and use them as markers so people can draw messages to one another over these projectors. We want to use a QR code next to the projectors to an app that has the marker colors for people to use there phones with. Processing is what we are going to use and camera recognition.We are mixing multimedia interconnectivity mixed with new technologies. It will be cool because of the interface that we are going to create because people will be interacting with each other while creating art pieces.
